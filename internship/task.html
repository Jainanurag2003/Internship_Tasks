                <p>McLaren is a British sports car and race car company that produces cars in the Sports, Super, and Ultimate Series</p>
                <p>McLaren Cars was incorporated on 2 December 1985 by Ron Dennis - an Englishman born in Woking, Surrey, England</p>
                <p>After a few years, McLaren announced its first road car in 1992, named McLaren F1. And that was designed by well-renowned car designer Gordon Murray. In 2010, McLaren Cars got renamed McLaren Automotive.Between 1994 and 2010, McLaren Cars was registered as a 'dormant company', before the founding of McLaren Automotive in 2010. The new company was originally separate from the existing McLaren companies to enable investment in the new venture, but was brought together in July 2017 after Ron Dennis sold his shares in McLaren Automotive and McLaren Group. </p>

                <p>In 1934, Aikawa separated the expanded automobile parts division of Tobata Casting and incorporated it as a new subsidiary, which he named Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.</p>
                <p>The shareholders of the new company; however, were not enthusiastic about the prospects of the automobile in Japan, so Aikawa bought out all the Tobata Casting shareholders (using capital from Nihon Industries) in June 1934. At this time, Nissan Motor effectively became owned by Nihon Sangyo and Hitachi.</p>
                <p>In 1935, the construction of its Yokohama plant was completed. 44 Datsuns were shipped to Asia, Central and South America. In 1935, the first car manufactured by an integrated assembly system rolled off the line at the Yokohama plant.[12] Nissan built trucks, airplanes, and engines for the Imperial Japanese Army. In November 1937 Nissan moved its headquarters to Xinjing, the capital of Manchukuo. In December the company changed its name to Manchuria Heavy Industries Developing Co (MHID).</p>
